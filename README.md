# Client-Side Navigation Error in Next.js 15

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when navigating between pages in a Next.js 15 application. The issue arises from attempting to parse JSON from `localStorage` directly within a component without proper error handling. This can lead to runtime errors if the `localStorage` item is missing or contains invalid JSON.

## Problem

The `about.js` file tries to parse JSON from `localStorage` upon initial render. If `localStorage` does not contain a valid JSON string, or if the key is missing, `JSON.parse()` will throw an error. This will disrupt client-side navigation in Next.js 15.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution by implementing a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during `JSON.parse()`.  This prevents the application from crashing and allows for graceful degradation.
